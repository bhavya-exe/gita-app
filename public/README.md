To add the Bhagavad Gita image:

1. Save the image you provided as "bhagavad-gita.jpg" in this directory (public/)
2. The image should be the one showing Krishna and Arjuna on the chariot with the orange/brown background
3. Make sure the file name is exactly "bhagavad-gita.jpg" (not .png or any other extension)

The image needs to be in this exact location:
C:\Users\bmalh\Downloads\gita-app\gita-app\public\bhagavad-gita.jpg
